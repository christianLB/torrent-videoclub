# Android Platform

This directory contains the native Android project created by Capacitor.

To build a debug APK from the repository root you can run:

```bash
npm run build-apk
```

The script copies the web assets and assembles the APK, which will be placed in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

See `../docs/android-firetv-build-guide.md` for a detailed guide.
